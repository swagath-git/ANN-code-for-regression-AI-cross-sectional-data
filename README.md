# ANN Regression (AI)

# Project Overview
A clean, well-documented implementation of an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for regression tasks using Python. This repository contains the Jupyter notebook `ANN python code for Regression (AI).ipynb` which demonstrates data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and inference — suitable for students, freshers, and practitioners who want a step‑by‑step guide to applying ANNs to regression problems.

## Key Features

* End-to-end notebook: data loading → preprocessing → model building → evaluation → prediction
* Clear separation of data preprocessing steps (scaling, encoding, train/test split)
* Modular model definition configurable for number of layers, activation functions, and optimizers
* Performance metrics for regression (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²)
* Visualizations for training history and prediction results

## Notebook Sections
1. Introduction & Objective :  — Problem statement and dataset summary
2. Data Loading & EDA : — Inspecting and visualizing the dataset
3. Preprocessing : — Handling missing values, encoding, scaling
4. Modeling : — ANN architecture and compilation
5. Training : — Fit the model and monitor training history
6. Evaluation : — Compute metrics and plot results
7. Save & Export :— Save trained models and predictions.
